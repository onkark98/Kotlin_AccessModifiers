# Kotlin Access Modifiers – Learning Notes

## Public (default)
- All classes and functions are public by default
- No need to explicitly write `public`
- Class-level: accessible everywhere
- File-level: accessible everywhere

## Private
- Class-level: accessible only within the class
- File-level: accessible only within the same file

## Key Difference from Java
- Kotlin does NOT have package-private
